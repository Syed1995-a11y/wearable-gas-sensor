# Wearable Gas Sensor Device

## 🌍 Project Overview
A wearable gas sensor device that detects hazardous gases and environmental conditions, interfaced with an ESP32 microcontroller and connected to a smartphone app via Bluetooth.

## ✨ Features
- Detects gases: CO, CO2, H2S, CH4  
- Reads environmental conditions: Temperature & Humidity  
- Real-time alerts on LILYGO T-Display S3 screen  
- Bluetooth-enabled mobile application for remote monitoring  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- ESP32 (LILYGO T-Display S3)  
- Arduino IDE / PlatformIO  
- C / C++ for firmware  
- Android Studio (if app is Android) or Xcode (if iOS)
